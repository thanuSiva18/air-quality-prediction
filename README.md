One-line description
A time-series forecasting project using Meta's Prophet to predict CO (Carbon Monoxide) concentration from historical air-quality measurements. The pipeline includes data preparation for Prophet, chronological train/test split, model training with explicit seasonal components, and an evaluation plan using MAE, RMSE and RÂ².

Summary
-------
This project forecasts CO concentration (target: "CO(GT)") using Prophet. The dataset contains 9,357 records. A custom DataFrame with columns `ds` (datetime) and `y` (target) was created for Prophet. A chronological 80/20 split was used (7,485 training / 1,872 testing). Prophet was configured with daily, weekly, and yearly seasonality and multiplicative seasonality mode. Model predictions for the test period are produced and evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².

Dataset
-------
- Rows: 9,357
- Target: `CO(GT)` (Carbon Monoxide)
- Key preprocessing step: create a DataFrame with columns:
  - `ds` â€” datetime (parsed to pandas.Timestamp)
  - `y` â€” numeric target (CO concentrations)
- Missing values: verify and handle as required (imputation or removal).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-------------------------------
- Plot time series to inspect trends, seasonality, and possible gaps.
- Visualize autocorrelation (ACF/PACF) to inspect lag structure.
- Check distributions and outliers for `CO(GT)` and other sensors.
- Plot rolling statistics (mean, std) to identify non-stationarity.

Data Preparation
----------------
- Create Prophet-compatible DataFrame:
  - df_prophet = df[['date_col', 'CO(GT)']].rename(columns={'date_col': 'ds', 'CO(GT)': 'y'})
  - Ensure `ds` is timezone-aware or naive consistently and sorted chronologically.
- Missing timestamps:
  - If timestamps are missing, consider reindexing to a regular frequency and imputing.
- Optional regressors:
  - Add external regressors (temperature, humidity, NOx, traffic) as extra columns and register them with Prophet using model.add_regressor(...).
- Logging / transformations:
  - Apply log-transform to `y` if distribution is heavily skewed; remember to inverse-transform predictions.

Train / Test Split
------------------
- Chronological split (no shuffling). For example:
  - Train: first 80% (7,485 samples)
  - Test: last 20% (1,872 samples)
- Use the test period timestamps as the prediction horizon (i.e., predict exactly on test `ds` values rather than forecasting fixed frequency steps when irregular timestamps are present).

Modeling & Evaluation
---------------------
- Model: Prophet (from prophet import Prophet)
- Configuration used:
  - yearly_seasonality=True
  - weekly_seasonality=True
  - daily_seasonality=True
  - seasonality_mode='multiplicative'
  - Add custom seasonalities if domain knowledge indicates (e.g., rush-hour).
- Training: fit on training DataFrame (ds, y, and regressors if any).
- Prediction: predict on test timestamps (or use make_future_dataframe if timestamps are regular).
- Evaluation metrics (compute after inverse-transforming if you transformed y):
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (RÂ²) â€” useful but interpret carefully for time series
- Visuals:
  - Plot actual vs predicted (time series plot)
  - Residual plot and histogram
  - Forecast components (trend + seasonality) from Prophet's plot_components

Example Code (Prophet)
----------------------
```python
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

# load
df = pd.read_csv("data/air_quality.csv", parse_dates=['date_col'])  # replace date_col with real name

# prepare for Prophet
df_prophet = df[['date_col', 'CO(GT)']].rename(columns={'date_col': 'ds', 'CO(GT)': 'y'})
df_prophet = df_prophet.sort_values('ds').dropna(subset=['y', 'ds'])

# chronological split
n = len(df_prophet)
train_end = int(0.8 * n)
train_df = df_prophet.iloc[:train_end].copy()
test_df = df_prophet.iloc[train_end:].copy()

# initialize and fit Prophet
model = Prophet(yearly_seasonality=True,
                weekly_seasonality=True,
                daily_seasonality=True,
                seasonality_mode='multiplicative')

# if you have external regressors:
# model.add_regressor('temperature')
# model.fit(train_df[['ds','y','temperature']])

model.fit(train_df)

# predict on test timestamps
future = test_df[['ds']].copy()   # preserve exact test timestamps
forecast = model.predict(future)

# align predictions
y_true = test_df['y'].values
y_pred = forecast['yhat'].values

# metrics
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_true, y_pred)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_true, y_pred, squared=False)
r2 = r2_score(y_true, y_pred)

print(f"MAE: {mae:.4f}, RMSE: {rmse:.4f}, R2: {r2:.4f}")
```

Results
-------
- Dataset: 9,357 records
- Train / Test: 7,485 / 1,872 (chronological split)
- Model: Prophet with daily/weekly/yearly multiplicative seasonality
- Model predictions were produced for the test period. Compute and record:
  - MAE: (compute and record here)
  - RMSE: (compute and record here)
  - RÂ²: (compute and record here)
- Visualization: plot actual vs predicted and forecast components to interpret seasonality and trend.

Limitations & Next Steps
------------------------
- Limitations:
  - Prophet models additive/multiplicative seasonality and trend extrapolation; abrupt external changes (events, sensor faults) are not captured unless provided as regressors or changepoints.
  - Irregular or sparse timestamps need careful handling (reindexing and imputation).
  - RÂ² can be misleading for non-stationary time series â€” prefer MAE/RMSE and cross-validated error.
- Next steps / improvements:
  - Add exogenous regressors (temperature, humidity, traffic) to improve predictive power.
  - Use Prophet's built-in cross-validation (prophet.diagnostics.cross_validation) to get time-series CV metrics and horizon-specific evaluation.
  - Tune changepoint_prior_scale and seasonality_prior_scale for better trend/seasonality flexibility.
  - Compare against other models (ARIMA/SARIMAX, Random Forest/GBM on lag features, LSTM).
  - Create lag / rolling statistical features and test ML models using those features.
  - Build a small API (FastAPI/Flask) to serve live predictions.
  - Containerize and schedule daily predictions with a cron/CI pipeline.
